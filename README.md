# Cryptographic Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as
cryptographic hashing functions. These implementations were developed primarily for educational purposes and to showcase
the mathematical underpinnings of these algorithms.

## 🚫 Disclaimer

These implementations are for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. They have not undergone any security
audits and may contain vulnerabilities. They should **NOT** be used in security-critical applications. Always rely on
established and thoroughly-audited cryptographic libraries for real-world, security-centric uses.
