# Cryptographic Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as
cryptographic hashing functions. These implementations were developed primarily for educational purposes and to showcase
the mathematical underpinnings of these algorithms.

## üö´ Disclaimer

These implementations are for **educational and demonstration purposes only**. They have not undergone any security
audits and may contain vulnerabilities. They should **NOT** be used in security-critical applications. Always rely on
established and thoroughly-audited cryptographic libraries for real-world, security-centric uses.

## üîç Project Overview

The goal of this project is to delve deep into the mathematical foundations and workings of cryptographic algorithms,
illustrating each step of the process in a clear and understandable manner.

### Implemented Algorithms

*Note: This section will be updated as algorithms are added.*

- **Symmetric Algorithms**:
    - *WIP: AES*

- **Asymmetric Algorithms**:
    - *TBD*

- **Hashing Algorithms**:
    - *TBD*

## üõ† Setup and Usage

*Details on setting up the environment and how to run the algorithms will be added here.*
