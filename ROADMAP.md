# Cryptographic Algorithms Implementation Roadmap

Implementing cryptographic algorithms from scratch can be an excellent way to dive deep into the mathematics and intricacies of encryption. Here's a suggested roadmap to guide your project.

## Disclaimers

- This implementation is for **educational purposes** only and should not be used in security-critical applications.
- Implementations in popular libraries like OpenSSL have undergone rigorous audits and optimizations. They should be preferred for real-world applications.

## 1. Understand the Mathematics

Start by delving deep into the mathematical foundations of the algorithms you aim to implement. For instance:
- Modular arithmetic for RSA
- Group theory for elliptic curves

## 2. Choose Symmetric Algorithms

Start with simpler symmetric ciphers to get a hang of the encryption process:
- **AES (Rijndael)**
- **DES** (outdated but simpler for learning)
- **Blowfish or Twofish**

## 3. Choose Asymmetric Algorithms

Move on to more complex public-key systems:
- **RSA**
- **DSA or ECDSA** for digital signatures
- **Diffie-Hellman** for key exchange
- **Elliptic-curve variants** like Curve25519 for modern encryption methods

## 4. Choose Hashing Algorithms

- **SHA-256**
- **MD5** (primarily for educational value; it's outdated and has vulnerabilities)
- **SHA-3**

## 5. Coding

- Begin with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Write unit tests before the actual implementation.
- Implement the algorithm.
- Compare and validate results with established libraries (like OpenSSL) for correctness.

## 6. Optimization (Optional)

If you're feeling ambitious:
- Optimize your initial implementation.
- Consider low-level performance improvements, though this isn't the main focus.

## 7. Documentation and Showcase

- Write clear and comprehensive comments.
- Document the mathematical foundations, algorithm steps, and your implementation nuances.
- Showcase your work on GitHub with:
  - A well-structured README
  - Clear project purpose and scope
  - Disclaimers, especially emphasizing the educational intent

Remember to always clarify that these implementations are meant for demonstration and learning, not real-world security applications.
