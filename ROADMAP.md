# Cryptographic Algorithms Implementation Roadmap

Implementing cryptographic algorithms from scratch offers a comprehensive exploration into the mathematics and intricacies of encryption. This roadmap provides guidance on how to systematically approach and realize such a project.

## Disclaimers

- The provided implementations are solely for educational objectives. They are not designed for deployment in security-sensitive applications.
  
- Well-established libraries, such as OpenSSL, are recommended for real-world applications due to their rigorous audits and optimizations.

## 1. Mathematical Foundations

Before diving into the actual coding, one must understand the mathematical principles that underlie cryptographic algorithms. For example:

- **Modular Arithmetic**: Vital for RSA.
  
- **Group Theory**: Essential for understanding elliptic curves.

## 2. Symmetric Algorithms Selection

Begin with basic symmetric ciphers to familiarize yourself with the encryption process:

- **AES (Rijndael)**: A widely adopted cipher.
  
- **DES**: Although outdated, its simplicity aids learning.
  
- **Blowfish or Twofish**: Other symmetric ciphers worth exploring.

## 3. Asymmetric Algorithms Selection

Proceed to the intricacies of public-key systems:

- **RSA**: A commonly used public-key cryptosystem.
  
- **DSA or ECDSA**: Useful for digital signatures.
  
- **Diffie-Hellman**: Pertinent for key exchanges.
  
- **Elliptic-curve variants**: Like Curve25519 for contemporary encryption techniques.

## 4. Hashing Algorithms Selection

Choose from several hashing algorithms, including:

- **SHA-256**: A standard cryptographic hash function.
  
- **MD5**: Though outdated and vulnerable, it provides educational insights.
  
- **SHA-3**: A member of the latest cryptographic hash functions.

## 5. Coding Process

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Begin by writing unit tests ahead of the actual implementation. This ensures functionality and aids debugging.
  
- **Implementation**: Craft the core algorithm.
  
- **Validation**: Cross-check results with renowned libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) to ensure accuracy.

## 6. Optimization (Optional)

For enthusiasts seeking further challenge:

- Fine-tune the initial codes.
  
- Delve into low-level performance enhancements. However, remember that the primary goal is understanding, not performance.

## 7. Documentation and Presentation

- **Commenting**: Embed clear and detailed comments in your code.
  
- **Documentation**: Detail the mathematical foundations, algorithmic steps, and unique aspects of your implementation.
  
- **Showcasing on GitHub**: A structured README, a well-defined project objective and scope, and disclaimers highlighting the educational intent are crucial.

Lastly, it's paramount to reiterate that these implementations are tailored for educational purposes. They are not recommended for actual security applications.
